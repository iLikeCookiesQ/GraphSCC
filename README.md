# GraphSCC
Master thesis Parallel SCC decomposition on directed graphs.
THE SRC FOLDER IS OUTDATED. I stopped committing and pushing source files when I let go of the plan to compile on the remote machine, 
but rather compile on the local machine and push/pull the JAR onto the remote machine. The JARs do have the updated versions.

You can find the source of the latest version at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_8xGEbuJ-LIMf5Ir91kkU7ttOkqP_lQW
